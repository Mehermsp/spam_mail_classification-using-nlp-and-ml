# spam_mail_classification-using-nlp-and-ml
This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
Features
Preprocessing: Text data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLP techniques.
Machine Learning Model: A classifier trained on labeled email data.
Streamlit Web App: A user-friendly interface to test the model with new inputs.
Environment Setup: Fully customized Python environment with Anaconda and VS Code.
Requirements
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
pickle
streamlit
Tools:
Python 3.8 or higher
